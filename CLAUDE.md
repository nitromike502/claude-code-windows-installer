# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a minimal repository containing scripts for installing Claude Code on native Windows systems. The project currently consists of only documentation files (README.md and LICENSE) with no source code, build systems, or dependencies yet implemented.

## Current State

The repository is in its initial state with:
- MIT License for open source distribution
- Basic README describing the project purpose
- No package.json, build scripts, or source code yet

## Development Notes

Since this is a Windows installer project that hasn't been implemented yet, future development will likely involve:
- PowerShell scripts for Windows installation
- Batch files for automation
- Potentially MSI or other Windows installer formats
- Documentation for installation procedures

No build, test, or lint commands are currently available as the project contains only documentation.
